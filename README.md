# OOP_CPP

Lab 1 Exercise:

1. Complex Example with "add" and "subtract" member functions.

2. Note: the following points will be covered in the lab (ask your lab assistant):
	
	1. Moving from .C to .CPP compiler:
	2. Flexible Deceleration of variables anywhere in theprogram.
	3. Eliminating "void" keyword from brackets in function headers.
	4. cin>> and cout<< streams.
	5. Dynamic allocation with "new" and "delete" operators.

3. Implement Swap function:
	
	1. Once call by value.
	2. Once call by Address.
	3. And call by Reference.

Lab 2 Exercise:

1. Complete Complex Class:
	
	1. Constructors
	2. Destructor
	3. setComplex functions.

2. Stack Class:
	
	1. Constructors
	2. Destructor
	3. Static members
	4. Push & Pop
	
3. B+ Stack Class with simple High lighted Menu:
	
	1. Take stack size from user first
	2. Show & handle these menu options
	


Lab 3 Exercise:

1. Complete Stack Class
	1. viewContent function once call by reference.
	2. viewContent function once call by value and without copy constructor . . (to seethe extra destructor call).
	3. viewContent function once call by value and with copy constructor.
	
	count objects and constructors and destructors calls

Note: You should Trace the code.


Lab 4 Exercise:


1. Complete Stack Class:
	1. = operator overload.


2.Complete Complex Class for:

		c3 = c1+c2;

		c3 = c1-c2;

		c3 = c1+5;

		c3 = c1-5;

		c3 = 5+c1;

		c3 = 5-c1;

		c1 == c2;


		c1 += c2;

		c1 -= c2;

		++c1;

		--c1;

		c1++;

		--c1;

		(float) c1;
	
Note: You should Trace the code.
