# OOP_CPP

Lab 1 Exercise:

	1. Complex Example with "add" and "subtract" member functions.

	2. Note: the following points will be covered in the lab (ask your lab assistant):

		1. Moving from .C to .CPP compiler:
		2. Flexible Deceleration of variables anywhere in theprogram.
		3. Eliminating "void" keyword from brackets in function headers.
		4. cin>> and cout<< streams.
		5. Dynamic allocation with "new" and "delete" operators.

	3. Implement Swap function:

		1. Once call by value.
		2. Once call by Address.
		3. And call by Reference.

Lab 2 Exercise:

	1. Complete Complex Class:

		1. Constructors
		2. Destructor
		3. setComplex functions.

	2. Stack Class:

		1. Constructors
		2. Destructor
		3. Static members
		4. Push & Pop

	3. B+ Stack Class with simple High lighted Menu:

		1. Take stack size from user first
		2. Show & handle these menu options



Lab 3 Exercise:

	1. Complete Stack Class
		1. viewContent function once call by reference.
		2. viewContent function once call by value and without copy constructor . . (to seethe extra destructor call).
		3. viewContent function once call by value and with copy constructor.

		count objects and constructors and destructors calls

Note: You should Trace the code.


Lab 4 Exercise:


	1. Complete Stack Class:
		1. = operator overload.


	2.Complete Complex Class for:

			c3 = c1+c2;

			c3 = c1-c2;

			c3 = c1+5;

			c3 = c1-5;

			c3 = 5+c1;

			c3 = 5-c1;

			c1 == c2;


			c1 += c2;

			c1 -= c2;

			++c1;

			--c1;

			c1++;

			--c1;

			(float) c1;
	
Note: You should Trace the code.


Lab 5 Exercise:

	1. Example of Association and Composition
		â€¢ Picture, Point, Rect Circle, Line

	2. Collections: Simple trials in the main( function to create object and array of objects from classes of (Line Rect,Circle

Note: You should Trace the code.


Lab 6 Exercise:
	
	1. Base, Derived, and SecondDerived [Test all cases at the main].
	
	2. Update picture application by add class Shape as a parent to lines , Rectangles and circles with color attribute.
	
Note: You should Trace the code.

	
Lab 7 Exercise:

	1. Example of:
		1. Base, Derived, and calculateSum().
	
	2. GeoShape Example:
		1. Try with public inheritance (try to violate the square and circle constraints bycalling the inherited setter methods).
		2. Try with protected inheritance not able to violate the square and circle constraints.
		3. Add the new special setter functions to class square and circle

Note: You should Trace the code.


Lab 8 Exercise:

	1. Continue the GeoShape Example:
		1. Make the function "calculateArea()" a pure virtual function, and make necessary changes to other classes.
		2. Write the standalone function sumOfAreas(~,~,~), which takes 3 parameters as pointers from type GeoShape.
		3. Not able to create objects of the abstract class GeoShape.
	
	2. Stack class with Templates
	
Note: You should Trace the code.
